## Blog Integration

I write technical articles and share my experiences on Hashnode. The blog section of my portfolio is automatically populated through Hashnode backup. Here's how it works:

1. **Hashnode Integration**:
   - I write and publish my blog posts on Hashnode
   - Hashnode automatically creates a backup repository with my blog posts
   - My portfolio website fetches and displays these posts

2. **Blog Features**:
   - Automatic updates when new posts are published
   - Markdown support
   - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Responsive images
   - Social sharing capabilities
