## Personal Website - Ratul Hasan Ruhan

## Design Inspiration
Based on research of authentic 90's websites, I'll incorporate these key elements:

### Visual Elements
- **Patterned backgrounds**: Starry night sky or geometric patterns
- **Bright color palette**: Memphis style with bold primary colors, pastels, and neon
- **Table-based layouts**: Classic 90's structure
- **Pixel fonts**: For headings and emphasis
- **Animated GIFs**: For decoration and navigation
- **Custom cursor**: Possibly with trailing effects
- **Under construction graphics**: For sections in progress
- **Visitor counter**: At the bottom of pages
- **Guestbook**: For visitors to leave messages

### Navigation
- Simple navigation with clickable image icons
- No dropdown menus (not common in early 90's)
- "Home" button on all pages
- Frames for consistent navigation across pages

### Interactive Elements
- Blinking text for important information
- Marquee scrolling text for announcements
- Background MIDI music (auto-playing)
- Image hover effects
- Hit counter
